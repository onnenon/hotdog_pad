# Hotdog Pad

## Configuration
Configuring the keys of the macropad is simple. To modify the keybindings navigate to [vial.rocks](https://vial.rocks) with your macropad plugged in to your computer.

_note, your browser must support WebHID to update your keybindings! If you use Chrome you don't have to worry about this._

### The default keymap of the macropad is:

| Key 1 | Key 2 | Key 3 | Key 4 | Encoder/Key 5 |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------:|
| `CMD+D` | `CMD+E` | `SHFT+CMD+5` | :hotdog: | Volume Up/Down |

`CMD+D` is toggle mute in Google Hangouts

`CMD+E` is toggle camera in Google Hangouts

`SHFT+CMD+5` opens the screenshot menu on MacOS
